Hi! This repository is maintained by Andy Gao for Assignment 1 of Introduction to Data Science COM SCI X 450.1, UCLA Extension Summer 2022.

My name is Andy Gao, and I'm currently a high school student. My main objective for this class is to mainly to explore and learn more about areas of interest. Some topics and ideas of mine for projects center around senior services/elder care, as well as seasonal shopping trends (including back-to-school season).
